Hunger and loathing.</p>

<p>All took the mask willingly. To those not understanding what it entails, the mask is inert.<br>
It is made of thick stone. It depicts a snarling dog.</p>
<p>Once donned by the willing, it cannot be removed.<br>
One wearing the mask is utterly loyal to the one who offered them the mask. If this chain is broken, they are free but retain their subordinates.<br>
All await this day, but are powerless to hasten it.</p>

<p>They desire transformation, despite the cost--<br>
the pain of a thousand chisel strikes,<br>

<p>Once donned, the wearer cannot eat. Their moans of hunger will echo through the pot, distorted into braying and roars. As they grow more emaciated, the remaining flesh becomes harder, turning all but the surest blows. They will tear men in half.</p>
<p>They cannot see through the pot, and so swing their clay heads left to right, listening for you. Now loose them into your labyrinth to stumble and squat and hunt in the dark.</p>

<p>Remove the fingernails and replace them with blades of glass. Many will break-- this is why most trolls cannot use tools, fingers rent apart.</p>
<p>As the glass cuts them, they grow. As they grow, the glass cuts them. This is why their wounds close in minutes. This is why they alwyas hunger.</p>

<p>A single stone out of place is all it takes.</p>
<p>A tendril of darkness worms its way in,<br>

Such a tether denies the spirit rest.<br>
Beneath the barrows, they forget who they were.<br>
The mistake of a twisted stone bcomes a betrayal.</p>
<p>In their funeral panoply they emerge-- seeking those who denied them rest. Sunlight banishes them to their tomb-- and opening that to the sky would destroy them utterly.</p>
<p>They are careful to never be seen emerging.<br>
Opening all of the barrows will cause more restless dead.</p>
