<p>Hollow yourself out and make a home for hunger.
Once you&#39;ve let it in, it will gnaw at the cage.
It will reach up to your heart and crush it.
It will reach up to your brain and gently mould it.</p>
<p>One who does this on purpose is reviled by those who fell victim to it-- yet they assemble in courts.
Hunger and loathing.</p>

<p><em>The body is as loyal as the mind, unwilling to die despite horrific wounds.</em></p>
<p>All took the mask willingly. To those not understanding what it entails, the mask is inert.
It is made of thick stone. It depicts a snarling dog.</p>
<p>Once donned by the willing, it cannot be removed.
One wearing the mask is utterly loyal to the one who offered them the mask. If this chain is broken, they are free but retain their subordinates.
All await this day, but are powerless to hasten it.</p>
<p>Domesticated animals and crops despise them, and wither in their captivity.</p>

<p>Some are able to hear the stone.
Most stone does not speak much--
but there is some that insists.</p>
<p>They desire transformation, despite the cost--
the pain of a thousand chisel strikes,
the assumption of the form of another.</p>
<p>Those who create such life are sure to die young and miserable, many with snapped necks, crushed ribs, broken spines.</p>

<p>Begin with clay. Form a pot in the shape of the head of a bull. The mouth must be wide enough to scrape the temples as it is pushed over the head.</p>
<p>Once donned, the wearer cannot eat. Their moans of hunger will echo through the pot, distorted into braying and roars. As they grow more emaciated, the remaining flesh becomes harder, turning all but the surest blows. They will tear men in half.</p>
<p>They cannot see through the pot, and so swing their clay heads left to right, listening for you. Now loose them into your labyrinth to stumble and squat and hunt in the dark.</p>

<p>Into each bleeding socket insert a tolon of glass. Many will break-- this is why most trolls cannpot speak, tongues a mess of ruined scraps.</p>
<p>Remove the fingernails and replace them with blades of glass. Many will break-- this is why most trolls cannot use tools, fingers rent apart.</p>
<p>As the glass cuts them, they grow. As they grow, the glass cuts them. This is why their wounds close in minutes. This is why they alwyas hunger.</p>

<p>A single stone out of place is all it takes.</p>
<p>A tendril of darkness worms its way in,
and coils itself around the corpse like a lover.
Such a tether denies the spirit rest.
Beneath the barrows, they forget who they were.
The mistake of a twisted stone bcomes a betrayal.</p>
<p>In their funeral panoply they emerge-- seeking those who denied them rest. Sunlight banishes them to their tomb-- and opening that to the sky would destroy them utterly.</p>
<p>They are careful to never be seen emerging.
Opening all of the barrows will cause more restless dead.</p>
