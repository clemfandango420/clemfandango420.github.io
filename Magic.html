<h2 id="locate-object">Locate Object</h2>
<p><em>One Use:</em> The skull of a bloodhound (or similar scenthound) is filled the skulls of nine different species of rodent. This rattle is then shaken, the sound an indicator of direction.</p>

<h2 id="magic-jar">Magic Jar</h2>
<p><em>One Use:</em> A soul-vessel is prepared, requiring a huge investment in research, blood and treasure. The transferral ritual takes a full month, during which the body must be maintained by others - any lapse in concentration causes failure. This one of the paths a man could walk to leave mortality behind.</p>
<p>The soul of the caster is moved to the soul-vessel. The spirit may leave and attempt to animate soulless bodies or vie with other souls for control of their own bodies. In this case, both make a Warding saving throw. If one passes and the other fails, they gain/retain control of the body. If both fail, the body dies, leaving only the caster.

<h2 id="move-earth">Move Earth</h2>
<p><em>One Use:</em> The hateful, parasitic Peak Crown flower is planted in the earth, where one wishes the earth to move to. The earth moves to destroy it, hills converging like wolves.</p>
<p>1d6 hills or equivalent move to the location violently, destroying structures and disrupting armies.</p>
<h2 id="neutralize-poison">Neutralize Poison</h2>
<p><em>One Use:</em> Bronze is poured over a de-fanged venomous snake. The resulting wand is waved at the envenomed object. <em>1/day:</em> A poison-gland from a live serpent, worn around the belt and milked every morning, can drain the poison from objects. This fetish is useless if the donor serpent dies.</p>
<p>An envenomed object or creature is purified, rendered harmless.</p>
<h2 id="passwall">Passwall</h2>
<p><em>One Use:</em> A fragment of a chisel from lost Uruk is used to mark a passage. Close your eyes and wait 1 minute.</p>
<p>Creates a tunnel up to 5’ in diameter and 15’ deep. The tunnel is permanent.</p>
<h2 id="phantasm">Phantasm</h2>
<p><em>One Use:</em> A sheet of gold-foil is folded into a paper approximation of the Phantasm to be evoked. <em>1/day:</em> The caster must break down the barrier between their own imagination and perception through massive hallucinogen usage and several mystical revelations.</p>
<p>An illusionary creature is animated and given life - convincing enough to deal real damage. Those observing closely may make a Warding saving throw to disbelieve the Phantasm - banishing it in doing so.</p>
<h2 id="plant-growth">Plant Growth</h2>
<p><em>One Use:</em> The caster imbibes a brew of rich loam and five lambs. They then cut themselves and flick their blood over the area.</p>
<p>The vegetation in an area rapidly grows, becoming an impassable tangle in minutes.</p>
<h2 id="polymorph">Polymorph</h2>
<p><em>One Use:</em> The caster wills themself into a new form over weeks of visualisation, will and deprivation. This new form is hidden in the confines of the mind and invokes through certain gestures and forms. Of course, in hindsight, they never changed form at all.</p>
<p>The caster transforms themselves into a new form.</p>
<h2 id="project-image">Project Image</h2>
<p><em>1/day:</em> The caster murders themselves in a different dimension or space, gaining the ability to invoke this other-self.</p>
<p>An illusion of the self is projected forth and acts as double - albeit one under control. Physical attacks pass through it harmlessly - magical attacks are redirected to the caster. Lasts 6 turns.</p>
<h2 id="protection">Protection</h2>
<p><em>One Use:</em> The caster anoints the target with blessed water. The origin of the blessing determines whom the protection is effective against.</p>
<p>Those the Protection is against take a -2 penalty on To Hit rolls against those under effect of a Protection. Lasts 6 Turns</p>
<h2 id="protection-from-missiles">Protection from Missiles</h2>
<p><em>One Use:</em> A bundle of arrows, each used to kill, is snapped. <em>1/day:</em> A charm made of golden arrowheads, each used to kill a man, is worn.</p>
<p>All normal missiles glance harmlessly from the target of this blessing. Lasts 12 Turns.</p>
<h2 id="sixth-sense">Sixth Sense</h2>
<p><em>One Use:</em> The dessicated head of a shark, pierced with two rods of silver, is used as dowsing rod. <em>1/day:</em> A series of slender copper, silver and gold rods are inserted into the vertebrae of the prospective caster.</p>
<p>The caster is able to hear the surface thoughts of all beings within 60’, and determine distance and direction to each creature ‘heard’. Lasts 12 Turns.</p>
<h2 id="slaying-spell">Slaying Spell</h2>
<p><em>One Use:</em> A natural rat-king is killed with a mallet.</p>
<p>10d6 HD of creatures die, starting with the nearest to the caster. Those with over 6HD are entitled to a Warding saving throw to resist.</p>
<h2 id="sleep">Sleep</h2>
<p><em>One Use:</em> A bear’s fecal plug is smoked and exhaled. <em>1/day:</em> The caster travels through Dream and back out again in a single sleep.</p>
<p>2d6+2 creatures are robbed of wakefulness, sleeping for 24 Turns if undisturbed.</p>
<h2 id="slow">Slow</h2>
<p><em>One Use:</em> Mud gathered from an ocean trench is flung. <em>1/day:</em> A herd of one hundred and one lamed horses must be kept alive by the caster or their estate.</p>
<p>A single target makes a Warding saving throw. If failed, they are Slowed - acting only every other round. Lasts 3 Turns.</p>
<h2 id="speak-with-animals">Speak with Animals</h2>
<p><em>One Use:</em> The tongue of a pig and the brain of an owl are left to fester in a buried jar for six months. The resulting fluid is imbibed. <em>1/day:</em> A series of platinum tongue-sheaths, corresponding to different manners of beasts, can be crafted.</p>
<p>For 6 Turns, the caster is able to converse with animals.</p>
<h2 id="speak-with-dead">Speak with Dead</h2>
<p><em>One Use:</em> Through the use of divinatory methods, vague and uncertain answers can be interpreted.</p>

<h1 id="appendix-1-turn-undead">Appendix 1: Turn Undead</h1>
<p>The unhappy dead forced to walk each respond to different banishment rituals, depending upon their faith in life. The teaching of such rites is often restricted to the upper echelons of the faiths - or their agents. Turned undead flee the area, making no attacks.</p>
<p>Christian and Muslim dead resist turning. They were raised early, their covenant broken. All they desire is revenge upon the cruel world. A holy symbol of silver may drive them back, although they make a Warding Save to resist. Each makes this save individually, and those passing are immune to further attempts.</p>
<p>The Druidic dead are turned by the flinging of earth gathered from the roots of an oak tree. 2d6HD of undead are driven back per round.</p>
<p>The dead of the ancient Norse are turned through recitation of deeds - for each successful Boast recounted, 1d6 of undead are turned.</p>

<p>The dead of the Marches do not attack those reciting the names and lineages of Belgic ancestors. Many has pass-phrases woven into them as part of their raising process.</p>
