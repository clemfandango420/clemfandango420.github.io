<p>Bandits covers &quot;normal&quot; hoards and those in war-torn areas. Bandits I is a local camp, Bandits III is a bandit-king.<br>Tombs are historical sites and ruins. Tomb I is a local ruin - Tomb V is the burial site of a historical conqueror.<br>Temples are both active and ruined holy sites. Temple I is a regional temple - Temple III is the central temple of a religion.<br>Monstrous covers hoards by those monsters known to accumulate treasure. Monstrous I is a goblin nest - Monstrous V is the wealth of a demon.<br>Magic-User covers hoards generated by those pursuing magical arts. Magic User I is a small hedge wizard - Magic User IV is a lich or wizard-king.<br>A Mythic hoard is ancient treasure, dragon hoards etc - the campaign defining haul. Items will be hidden beneath mountains of conventional wealth.</p>
<p>20%:1 means a 20% chance of single item of that type being present. </p>
<h1 id="coins">Coins</h1>
<p><em>Hoards of coins do not occur under normal conditions. Coins are hoarded as things begin falling apart. Hoards which are found were never claimed by their originator.</em></p>
<p>Coins taken from pockets with grubby fingers will be of mixed modern types, and usable as tender unless a polity is actively enforcing its own coinage. </p>
<p>Coins discovered in hoards will tie to the time of their origin - use the below Special Coinages if uncertain.<br>Certain accumulative hoards as gathered by certain types of inhuman monsters (ogres, bankers etc) will mostly be of local, modern types (as dictated by geography*) but may (20% chance) have one of the below Special Coins. Special Coins can be used as normal coinage or sold to historians, scholars and collectors.</p>
<p>*<em>n.b. viking hoards reveal silver dhirrams alongside less distant coinage.</em></p>
<h2 id="1-bronze-imitations">1. Bronze Imitations</h2>
<p>Prior to the near-extinction of local indigenous culture, they lived alongside the eventual conqueror-exterminators. They would cast imitation coinage in bronze - not in deceit, but aspirationally. The faces of the fractious chiefs and druids replace the lineages of emperors. The shape of writing rendered as a pattern, robbed of meaning. Eventually, once fortunes reversed, these bronze imitations became the coin of the realm, the erstwhile conquerors melting down their golden discs. </p>
<p>Thick, crude coins. Each worth 1sp, 20sp to a collector.<br>Found in groups of 5d20 amongst hoards in the lands of the former empire.<br>Obverse - Druids, Horned Helms, Battleaxes, Rampant Horses.<br>Reverse - Ships, Roads, Trees, Near-Writing. </p>
<h2 id="2-silver-tetradrachm">2. Silver Tetradrachm</h2>
<p>Silver beaten to the thinnest possible edge whilst retaining any integrity - they can easily be folded into nuggets. Issued by an early merchant city to combat rampant clipping - any attempted modification utterly destroying the coinage. If suspended and struck, they chime like bells - a request, apocryphally, from the husband of a particularly successful merchant who insisted on counting their collection personally.</p>
<p>Razor-thin silver coins. Each worth 1sp, 10sp to a collector. Worthless to collectors if folded.<br>Found in stacks of 2d100 amongst hoards in historical trading zones.<br>Obverse &amp; Reverse - no markings</p>
<h2 id="3-coat-of-coins">3. Coat of Coins</h2>
<p>Barbarian kings commissioned these mail-coin-coats as a sign of wealth and scorn for the unpractical wealth of civilised people. These coats are found near-exclusively as grave-goods of such kings - and many still honour them. Wearing such a coat is sure to alert those remaining faithful to your sacrilege. </p>
<p>The most successful kings had patterns formed of coins of many subjugated kingdoms - the complementary shapes increasing the protection afforded, as well as flaunting victory over more subject peoples.</p>
<p>Provides AC as Leather if a single coinage is used, AC as Chain if 2-3 coinages are used, and AC as Plate if 4+ coinages are used. </p>
<p>1d10*1000 Heterogeneous coins sewn to backing fabric. Random coins can be pulled off at 1sp each, or the coat sold for 1000sp to a collector.<br>Found as a singleton only.<br>Vanishingly rare.
<em>Use other coins to determine obverse &amp; reverse.</em></p>
<h2 id="4-victory-aureus">4. Victory Aureus</h2>
<p>Each was minted for a year in celebration of a Society General defeating another foreign kingdom. The coins always depict a wolf striking down a feeble animal - the national animal of a defeated people. Beyond this heavy-handed iconography, there is no further mention of victory upon the coins. Some are mentioned only via the coins - they were too minor to be included in their annals.</p>
<p>Chunky electrum coins. Worth 10sp, 20sp to a collector.<br>Found in stashed hoards and barbarian hauls, 1d6*100.<br>Obverse - Side-profile heads &amp; date markings<br>Reverse - Wolf striking down animals</p>
<h2 id="5-doubleface-drachm">5. Doubleface Drachm</h2>
<p>Silver coins marked by two oddities - the obverse always depicts a pair of faces, each facing outwards albeit tilted away. There seems to be endless variations - implying hand-made coins or a very long run. The second oddity is on the reverse - small lines and markings implying an order but without any obvious guide. The obverse and reverse are always paired. The originating city is unknown. </p>
<p>If 500 unique coins can be assembled (1% chance of any two given coins being the same) and arranged, the reverse is revealed to be a map. The centre depicts a city found on no other map. You would not be the first to try and assemble the map.</p>
<p>Heavy silver coins. Worth 15sp, 30sp to a casual collector, 100sp to someone assembling the map.<br>1d6 found in many hoards - as if a curio.<br>Obverse - A pair of faces.<br>Reverse - Disorganised lines (map sections to the initiated).</p>
<h2 id="6-twisted-javelinheads">6. Twisted Javelinheads</h2>
<p>Prior to coinage being widespread, trade across the archipelago was facilitated through the trade of these bronze javelinheads - the tin used requiring significant effort to import from distant isles. In legends, kings would make scaled armour by hammering them flat and riveting them together. Now they can be found, coated in verdigris across the arid land.</p>
<p>Bronze pointed cone. Worth 5sp, 25sp to a collector.<br>Found near the oldest cities and those who raided them in [1. 1d6, singletons 2. 1d20, stacked 3.1d100, loose 4. d6*100, stacked and tied]</p>
<h2 id="7-overclipped-coins">7. Overclipped Coins</h2>
<p>Amongst criminal classes, badly or overly clipped coins are still exchanged at half-value. They tend to accumulate into ever-larger hoards in the interior, but are easily passed as legitimate on the borderlands - ensuring their dispersal. Some are surprised when they find the genuine article, their smaller kingdoms having adopted these clipped coins as their own specie.</p>
<p>Various, but thin, cracked, damaged, sharp or rough. Worth half conventional value. Worth nothing to a collector.<br>Constitutes 30% of a hoard near a current or previous border. Criminal stashes have 1d20*100 coins.<br>Obverse &amp; Reverse - barely distinguishable.</p>
<h2 id="8-gold-imitations">8. Gold Imitations</h2>
<p>The story goes that a barbarous kingdom tried to ape an empire by casting their own imitations - but being far richer in gold than silver, they created coins of much greater value than intended.<br>This story is a lie - they were attempting to sway mercantile interest as a bulwark against the empire. Instead, they summoned armies.</p>
<p>Chunky gold coins - worth 10sp, 50sp to a collector.<br>Found in the ruins of occupier military camps and sunken mercantile vessels, 4d20 at a time.<br>Obverse - Side-profile heads and dates.
Reverse - Horses, Wolves, Roads, Lighthouses.</p>
<h2 id="9-nomad-bowls">9. Nomad Bowls</h2>
<p>From the steppe they road and burnt cities who would not bend the knee. Rather than quibble over coins and exchange, the conquerors established something new. A small thimble with a matching rod. Other coins are socketed into the thimble, and pounded into a stackable bowl with the rod.<br>Those found using any other value-token were strapped to the back of a horse and dragged a mile for each illegal coin used.<br>Gifting the thimble and rod was a mark of great honour - or of collaboration with the occupiers. </p>
<p>Small bowls of gold and silver - worth 10/5sp respectively, worth 30/20sp to a collector.
Found in stacks of 2d100 silver and 1d100 gold in hoards everywhere - traded widely.</p>
<p><em>A thimble-and-rod would be worth 1500sp to a collector.</em></p>
<h2 id="10-cowry-shells">10. Cowry Shells</h2>
<p>The delicate curves, soft cream shade and toothy opening uniquely identify these shells, used for trade across borders since time immemorial. Far lighter than coins, many more can be carried - and far harder to falsify. Across the weight of history, far more blood has been shed over these little shells than coins of gold and silver.</p>
<p>Small shell - worth 2sp in various cultures and all coastal cities. Has no collectors.
Found in wrecks and near the coast in sacks of 2d8*100 or 1d6 &quot;threads&quot; of 100 each.</p>
<h2 id="11-dog-spirit-bank">11. Dog Spirit Bank</h2>
<p>A ward against thieves and idle spending - coins stashed away within these fired pottery dogs. Fat, squat and heavy, their collars are marked with protection glyphs. They vary in size from the palm of your hand to life-size - and each is stamped with numerals atop their head. Breaking one was taboo - so as they filled up, they became the unit of exchange themselves.<br>The story says that those who tried to fill their dog-banks with lead weight would die at night, bellies full of sharpened coins. </p>
<p>Pottery Dog - worth 50, 100, 250 or 500sp to a collector. Can be smashed for half this value in small silver coins which can be spend normally. 10% chance of still containing a guardian spirit. Can do anything a dog or ghost could do - will haunt the breaker until a new dog-pot is made and filled.<br>Found in buried estates and as grave-goods. Peasants would have a 50sp dog, and nobles 2d6 500sp dogs.<br>Obverse (of the coins) - Dogs, Roads, Trees.
Reverse (of the coins) - Depictions of internal organs.</p>
<h2 id="12-demonface-coins">12. Demonface Coins</h2>
<p>Overwrought, heavy, and unable to stack - these coins are ill-suited by most measures. They are not even made of a precious metal - they consist of pitted iron.  Each depicts a snarling demonic face, which projects outwards from the coinface.<br>When conjured up and questioned, demons themselves are only quiet and uncomfortable when it comes to these coins. They are bound to not speak on them.<br>The coins drink heat hungrily, but do not let it go - they are always cold to the touch.<br>If broken, the demon bound within is released, and must perform one act for the breaker.</p>
<p>Iron sculpture-coins - worth 2000sp to a very particular type of collector.<br>Found singleton in particularly ancient or sorcerous hoards.<br>Obverse - Completely unique snarling demon face.
Reverse - Detailed circles and protective glyphs. </p>
<h1 id="goods-1d100">Goods (1d100)</h1>
<p>If rolled, 1d4 types of trade good will be present. Divide the amount required by the per-item value to get how many items are present. </p>
<p>Values are average - quality will vary across instances of an item - a single precious stone may make up half the rolled value. Distance from origin increases value - double prices for every two weeks travel to nearest source. </p>

<h1 id="artefacts-d20">Artefacts (d20)</h1>
<p>Where artefacts are present, roll or select from the below.</p>
<h2 id="1-drowning-weights">1. Drowning Weights</h2>
<p>To be married to the Sea is considered unseemly to these coastal people. The sea is like an animal, to be tamed and used, not loved.</p>
<p>Found in hidden, shameful places, these are dinner-plate sized iron disks with square holes in the centre. They are usually an inch thick, with no decorations or designs. </p>
<p>Before adulthood is obtained, one is expected to wear the weights and reject the Sea&#39;s embrace. Those lost, it is hoped, sate the hungry waters. They act as a reminder for those who return.</p>
<p>The genuine, used articles are worth 250sp to collectors, removed enough to not fully grasp what such an item being for sale represents. </p>
<p>Those openly carrying them on the coast are shunned. They might wake up, pinned down and branded. </p>
<h2 id="2-treeheart">2. Treeheart</h2>
<p>Foresters will speak of heartwood - the central core of the tree, shrouded in sapwood.<br>This knot of smooth, unpolished wood is not that.<br>Children lost to the wood sometimes return, clutching one of these fist-sized nodules. As long as they retain the nodule, they have nothing to fear from the donor forest.<br>This charm does not follow possession of the bauble, although stories claim it does. Second-hand possessors will find themselves wandering the woods in dreams. Something follows them. </p>
<p>Worth 500sp to collectors. </p>
<h2 id="3-faerie-boats">3. Faerie Boats</h2>
<p>Tiny bronze boats, washed up on the riverbank. Before a maiden voyage, they are cast out into the waters - either to trick the river, satiate it or thank it, depending who is asked. Removing one from the river is said to doom the vessel. </p>
<p>During petty wars and raids, youths known for prodigious patience and lung capacity are set to find and steal such charms. Many have died in the river, pierced by guardians or dragged away elsewhere by the flow, bodies never found. The grimmest stories have them as crew to these tiny bronze boats.</p>
<p>Worth 150sp to collectors.</p>
<h2 id="4-cloak-of-hands">4. Cloak of Hands</h2>
<p>Named for the palm-shaped leaves used to construct it, these cloaks are prized for their low weight and waterproof nature. As long as they are kept watered and exposed to sunlight, the leaves are capable of surviving indefinitely. They also function as camouflage - something relied upon by bandits and resistance fighters. Soldiers of many nations have charged into the undergrowth to find nothing.</p>
<p>If the wearer is struck by a single slashing attack, the cloak is ruined.</p>
<p>Worth 25sp natively, 200sp beyond the borders. </p>
<h2 id="5-old-key">5. Old Key</h2>
<p>When property must be abandoned there is much to consider. Many plan on returning, and keep a key. They are passed down generations, against the day of their return. Every key is an unfulfilled promise, a rusted chain of custody. Their tales cipher maps and directions to the promised places, even if young ears and old tongues do not recognise them as such.<br>If stolen, pursuit is inevitable.</p>
<p>Worth 5sp.</p>
<h2 id="6-god-casket">6. God Casket</h2>
<p>Iron-bands coil around a box, wood soaked in bitumen. It was not built to be opened, only closed. Within is the god of a city, long buried, the inhabitants moved on by time. When the first to ride carts for war came, they would conquer. As their gore-splattered vehicles moved through the streets, the royal guard would storm the temple and steal the city-god - the ultimate sign of defeat. Such prizes were sealed away in these boxes - to demoralise and control the now-captive populace. Even when their victory was revisited upon them, the gods were not liberated.<br>How they were scattered is not known.</p>
<p>Worth 350sp, or 5000sp to one seeking to reunite a people. </p>
<h2 id="7-falcon-hood">7. Falcon Hood</h2>
<p>The Watchful bid to blind the hunting birds roosting in their temple - each hood a facsimile of one of the Hundred Faces Used to Watch. Each bird loses it&#39;s name, becomes the current incarnation of the lineage. The birds originated many of the current hunting lines - the names of such ciphers for the names of each of the Hundred Faces Used to Watch. </p>
<p>Worth 350sp to a collector.</p>
<h2 id="8-copied-codex">8. Copied Codex</h2>
<p>Across mountains, seas and bogs they came, dying as they did. Whatever they brought must be important. Words without interpreters - those died along the way - given with ceremony and reverence. So copies were made. To die in service of such an item clarifies its importance.  </p>
<p>This is six or seven generations removed, and the original words are no longer legible - rendered only as decorative snarls of lines and elegant swoops. They are still treated with reverence.  </p>
<p>When the source church discoverers them, they are burnt as heretical. Bands of believers have ambushed such imposters already. </p>
<p>Worth 500sp to the church - as a bounty.</p>
<h2 id="9-crypt-censer">9. Crypt Censer</h2>
<p>As the dead lie unmoving, scented smoke snakes through the corridors, filling the air - pressing in upon any who stir from rest. As long as the air is filled, peace reigns in the crypt.<br>The delicate silver walls of the censer are stained nicotine-yellow from the low, slow burn. Some herbs remain within. It remains warm to the touch, despite present circumstance. </p>
<p>Somewhere, a crypt is full of restless corpses.</p>
<p>Worth 350sp to a collector. If openly sold, the party are marked as grave-robbers. </p>
<h2 id="10-mummified-dog">10. Mummified Dog</h2>
<p>The acid waters of the bog would have delivered this animal to eternity - but instead it has been vomited up, boneless-yet-rigid, tanned by slow liquid seep. It was promised an eternal hunting ground.  </p>
<p>You could put it on a bookshelf. </p>
<p>Worth 150sp to a collector. </p>
<h2 id="11-gilt-chariot">11. Gilt Chariot</h2>
<p>An oversized, heavy construction of wood, trimmed in gold, wheels as tall as a man and shod in iron. The double-crossbar yoke extending forward fits eight horses. Hooks for war-trophies stud much of the structure. No expense was spared. The sides of the chariot are decorated with paper-mache scenes of carnage - huge figures tear down walls, eat men whole, burn forests. </p>
<p>Worth 3000sp to a collector. </p>
<h2 id="12-brand">12. Brand</h2>
<p>A broken ring, radiating spikes. Heated in a fire until cherry-red, then applied to the cheek of an oathbreaker.<br>Healers displaced and outcast would say the only cure for branding was burying the tool used to apply it.</p>
<p>Worth nothing - they are still made today. </p>
<h2 id="13-ivory-miniature">13. Ivory Miniature</h2>
<p>Fits in the hand comfortably, the cream-yellow of the ivory drinking in light. The figure is squared, each face depicting a different figure. The first is a child, a tree leaning over them. The next is an adult, holding tools. The third clutches a child. The fourth face has been abraded smooth. Time has devoured the final face. Suggestions are all that remain - enough to justify any interpretation.</p>
<p>Worth 200sp to a collector. </p>
<h2 id="14-stone-sword">14. Stone Sword</h2>
<p>A uselessly blunt stone sword - barely functional as a club. Blood splatters have been carved into the blade, simulating use. The stone is light and porous. </p>
<p>Worth 100sp to a collector. In 1d20 weeks, they may try and contact you again.</p>
<hr>
<p>The sword does not stand alone. In a bog, thick with fog, a statue of a cyclops clutches it&#39;s eye. A wound has been sculpted in the eye - which perfectly fits the sword. Completed, it reveals a tomb, wherein giants were interred to deny them rest. The old stories claim the heroes guard the corpses against awakenings. </p>
<h2 id="15-genealogical-tree">15. Genealogical Tree</h2>
<p>Cast in gold, silver and electrum, this figure of a tree stands a foot high, delicate leaves each printed with a name. The branches and leaves trace the lineage of a kingdom abandoned - the villages, towns, people still present but the animus of a royal family entirely absent. In the base of the figure, blank leaves and inscription tools. </p>
<p>Worth 3500sp to potential monarchs.<br>Worth killing you over to stay free of kings.</p>
<h2 id="16-fairypenny">16. Fairypenny</h2>
<p>An inflexible, leathery disk - one face with the distinctive gills of a mushroom. Pleasant to turn over and over in your fingers. Dirty like an old coin. Only found in old collections, in basements and tombs. The origin is lost - perhaps from over-harvesting.</p>
<p>Worth 50sp to a collector - 250sp in goods in rural communities.</p>
<hr>
<p>A mark of good fortune, and a gentle warning - the bearer is not to be cheated nor wronged. The punishments vary from spoiled milk to stolen children. </p>
<h2 id="17-puddingstone">17. Puddingstone</h2>
<p>Atop a witches coffin, or worn around the neck - the puddingstone is held to be a protective charm. Each puddingstone is shaped, the many smaller pebbles polished to stand against the background material. The amulets are rarely found - the slabs used to seal coffins are far more common. </p>
<p>Worth 150sp to a collector. </p>
<hr>
<p>Removing a puddingstone from a grave is a cause for open exile. If any witches remain, they are likely to seek you out and thank you. </p>
<h2 id="18-sun-amulet">18. Sun Amulet</h2>
<p>Dirt-encrusted gold - wide as a dinnerplate, with a chain to match. The sun smiles beatifically. Long has it craved the touch of light. They were scattered and buried when the invaders came. Those who buried them were killed for hiding wealth, and so the amulets stayed lost.</p>
<p>Worth 250sp to a collector. Worth 500sp to the remaining Sun-Cultists.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Sun-Cult will find you if this discovery is public. They will beg you to show them where. If you do not comply, they will try and slander you - they are used to working in the shadows.</p>
<h2 id="19-fools-cymbals">19. Fool&#39;s Cymbals</h2>
<p>The blood of siblings is not spilled lightly in the courts to the West - other punishments are devised for those that plot and scheme. Cymbals and bells, chained and locked to the body. Removal would take hours, and carries a taboo.  </p>
<p>Worth 500sp to a collector.</p>
<hr>
<p>The sound is now associated with fratricide - the indignity accelerated bloodshed rather than cooling tempers. The cymbal is forbidden in courts and halls that remember. </p>
<h2 id="20-ships-head">20. Ship&#39;s Head</h2>
<p>A ship&#39;s spirit can be broken without sinking. Boarded, one who used to be a woodsman, far removed from home, moves to the prow of the vessel and strikes off her head. This prize is carried back, leaving the victim unfit for sea in the eyes of superstitious sailors. If the head is buried ashore, even worse - the ship is doomed to sink.</p>
<p>Worth 350sp to collector.</p>

<h1 id="magic-items-d100">Magic Items (d100)</h1>
<h2 id="01-10-magic-weapons-d20">01-10. Magic Weapons (d20)</h2>
<h3 id="1-stone-knife">1. Stone Knife</h3>
<p>Found in the soil. Blunt, rounded. Has no guard - a loose grip ensures cut fingers. Carved into each is a face, mouth yawning open.<br>Drinks blood. Note damage dealt. This blood can be wrung out and drunk - healing HP equal to damage dealt.<br>Stores up to 15HP.</p>
<p>Deals 1d6-1 Damage.</p>
<hr>
<p>The face is that of an Eater - a class of spirit in the local folkloric traditions. Whether the knife represents, contains, or <em>is</em> an Eater is unclear. Wielding it openly results in protective gestures, narrowed eyes and terse conversation. At night, the brave or desperate might steal into your camp to steal the knife. </p>
<h3 id="2-javelin-of-thorns">2. Javelin of Thorns</h3>
<p>The bones of something unnamed and forgotten, washed up on a shore. Not a wholeness, but a collection of many. Tiny bone splinters align to a single point, and quiver in the dry. They miss the embrace of wet flesh. Those pierced by this javelin are infested with these thorns, the javelin burrowing and unfolding, deep into their flesh. It cannot be removed without butchery. This takes a Turn. </p>
<p>Deals 1d6 hits of 1d6 damage each. Any surviving this blow take -5 to all rolls, every movement agony.<br>If a throw misses, 2-in-6 chance the javelin is destroyed.<br>If used in melee, deals 1d6 damage to the wielder. </p>
<p>Useless against those without living flesh. </p>
<hr>
<p>The wielder of the Javelin will find themselves challenged to feats of accuracy by all who recognise this weapon. </p>
<h3 id="3-revenant-sword">3. Revenant Sword</h3>
<p>A warrior must be armed in the afterlife. To achieve this, their blade would be broken, and cast into the river nearest their birth-hall.<br>Fish out these pieces, and recast them at night, adding lead. This disarms the spirit, and infuses the blade with fury. It is always cold to the touch.  </p>
<p>Deals 1d6+2 damage. If a 6 is rolled, roll 1d6. On a 6, the blade shatters, eager to fail. </p>
<hr>
<p>Flaunting such a weapon sours relationships. None would move against you directly, but doors are sure to close. Rumours spread of necromancers and black dogs. </p>
<h3 id="4-eyebiter">4. Eyebiter</h3>
<p>Shaft of elm and head of silver. The head is serrated, and gleams like the eyes of shark. Eyebiter has split a hundred helmets - she delights in the wet warmth within the head, hidden behind the eye. Other flesh spoils her appetite. Buried with a wielder far less famous than the spear itself - enough to have been considered lost. </p>
<p>Deals 1d6 damage. Adds 2 to hit and damage rolls versus humans. Subtracts 2 to all other hit and damage rolls.</p>
<hr>
<p>Eyebiter&#39;s reputation is conferred upon the wielder - a killer of men. </p>
<h3 id="5-drowned-dog">5. Drowned-Dog</h3>
<p>Dangerous animals are not always terminated - some are kept nearby, under chains and muzzles, to be set loose amongst enemies.<br>A haft of ash-grey, leading into a waxed leather sack. It sloshes when moved, and smells of salt. The seawater within keeps the axe-head asleep. If removed, the axe springs to life, teeth of flame snarling over the cutting edge of the blade. It jumps like an ill-trained hound, too keen on the hunt. To not attack a moving thing every round a Strength roll is required. Likewise, forcing it back into the bag requires such a feat. Failure in either instance causes 1d6 damage to the wielder. </p>
<p>Deals 1d6+3 damage. Adds 1 to hit.</p>
<hr>
<p>Those who are thralls to weapons are not welcome in peaceful places. They are tolerated where they might be useful.</p>
<h3 id="6-giantish-sword">6. Giantish Sword</h3>
<p>Too big. The hands of captives worked the smaller details into the blade, the guard, the handle. Between scenes of captivity are pleas for release, longings for death - too fine for giant eyes to see. Such miserable prayers only accumulate power as they are denied.</p>
<p>Deals 2d6 damage. Subtracts 2 to hit. Cannot be swung by a mortal - unless swung at one who denies others freedom. </p>
<hr>
<p>Such an immense weapon ensures attention from all quarters. Any who recognise it for a Giant blade will urge you to bury it, fearing a return. </p>
<h3 id="7-bloodball">7. Bloodball</h3>
<p>Cast from an admixture of serpents blood and powdered rams skulls, these pinkish nodules delight in the killing of kings and guardians. The mould to make more was destroyed in the final invasion of the isles. There are less than 500 left.</p>
<p>Launched by a sling, deals 1d6+2 damage to those in authority over the launcher. Otherwise, they are harmless.</p>
<p>3d12 are found at a time.</p>
<hr>
<p>All have demands upon a liberator who does not hide. Kings command surrender, the downtrodden plead liberation.</p>
<h3 id="8-proven-sons">8. Proven Sons</h3>
<p><em>whereupon riddled,</em><br><em>made a bed for war-thorn</em><br><em>mound-hunters fate once more upon the earth.</em><br><em>and earls and trusted men</em><br><em>crept forward and from forge-bat</em><br><em>plucked a dozen proven sons.</em>  </p>
<p>Shot from a bow, deals 1d6+6 damage against Dragons and others of their ilk. Otherwise, treat as a normal arrow.</p>
<p>Single arrows are found occasionally.</p>
<h3 id="9-partsword">9. Partsword</h3>
<p>An unornamented knife belies a hidden blade, hammered to an edge between the flickering of the sun and invisible to the human eye. It needs a full sized scabbard - your murderous intent must still be signalled with knife-grip for the surprise to have full effect.</p>
<p>Deals 1d6 damage. Adds +4 to hit the first time it is used, and +2 to hit thereafter. </p>
<h3 id="10-plague-club">10. Plague Club</h3>
<p>A length of polished wood, perfectly smooth - a veneer of varnish leaving it reflective. It is far heavier than it&#39;s length would suggest. Knocked against something, it sounds partially hollow. If cut or pierced, foulness flows forth - pus, blood, rotten organs, teeth soured and turned chalky. It flows such for a week. </p>
<p>Deals 1d6 damage. Those surviving are cured of disease. </p>
<hr>
<p>If rumour spreads, a procession of the diseased will begin searching for the wielder.</p>
<h3 id="11-nest-of-snakes">11. Nest-of-Snakes</h3>
<p>An unpolished iron blade, extending from a guard-less grip of deep-yellow bone wrapped with hide. Across the blade, straight ribbons of different shades and texture criss-cross. When hidden from the sun, these ribbons begin to move, becoming less rigid - they begin to extend out from the blade as pale, ghostly wisps which entwine and fight one another. They can pass through any substance in this state, necrotising flesh in their passage. </p>
<p>Deals 1d6 damage. Adds 1 to hit. If away from sunlight, deals 1d6+2. Wielder secretly loses 1 Constitution permanently a month. After 4 months, people begin to notice. </p>
<hr>
<p>Protomyths and tomb-carvings reveal a motif - a stone falls from the sky. From the stone, a sword that kills the wielder over time. The sword is buried with them, until another decides to burn bright, hot and short.</p>
<h3 id="12-tooth-of-hunger">12. Tooth of Hunger</h3>
<p>Always wrapped in silks rather than any conventional scabbard - at least three colours. The grip is filthy with the grease of a thousand hands. The blade is etched with clouds and peaceful faces. When drawn, sleep tries to seize the wielder. Those struck feel a similar pull. Those who do always find themselves in a labyrinth of arm. They know Hunger pursues them. The sky laughs.</p>
<p>Deals 1d6 damage. When drawn, the wielder must Save or fall asleep for 1d6 Turns. Those struck must make a Save or fall asleep for 1d6 Turns.</p>
<hr>
<p>How does a blade that steals wakefulness seem more profane than a sword that only steals life?</p>
<h3 id="13-armwolf">13. Armwolf</h3>
<p>A 3&#39; length of curved yellowed bone, tapering to a point. The inner edge is serrated with teeth of greened bronze. It looks as if the bone has grown around them. It is unwieldy on the swing - it wants to twist and present those teeth back towards the wielder. </p>
<p>Deals 1d6+2 damage. Damage may be rerolled, but if the new result is less than the previous, that damage is dealt to the wielder instead. </p>
<hr>
<p>Those held in dominion to something of water and salt improved upon natural weapons. Another came and tore off this tusk. Above the waves, nothing else remains of the story. Beneath the waves, this trespass is remembered. </p>
<h3 id="14-sanctuary">14. Sanctuary</h3>
<p>A 6&#39; length of gold, terminating in three arms at one end and 4 feet at the other. Each arm has a divot and a spike within that - for the holding of candles. Wielded as a staff, it feels far lighter than it should. </p>
<p>Deals 1d6 damage. Adds 1 to hit. Those struck once may not approach the wielder. Confers the benefits of a shield.</p>
<hr>
<p>The story is popular - raiders came for a monastic order. The abbotess brained the leader of the band, and none other dared approach. She waited until dawn arrived - the bandits fading into the night.</p>
<h3 id="15-running-net">15. Running Net</h3>
<p>A corded gut net, each corner weighted with the lead-filled skull of a ferret. Their claws and teeth are woven into the netting. If an attempt to throw it misses, it will scurry across the floor and seek the feet of the quarry, entangling them in 1d6-2 rounds. </p>
<p>Deals no damage. Subtracts 2 to hit.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Scurry scurry<br>fear and flurry<br>ferrets four<br>divest&#39;d of paw<br>bound up tight<br>hunt the night<br>watch your feet<br>or teeth they&#39;ll meet</em></p>
<h3 id="16-itheadair-cinnidh">16. Itheadair Cinnidh</h3>
<p>Four and a half feet of blade extend outward from forward-thrown quillons. The entire affair is unadorned, and lacks the finishing touches of a commissioned sword. It is a remnant of a clan destroyed - and the destroyer of another. Purpose fulfilled, now it alone remains.</p>
<p>Deals 1d6+2 damage. Tries to become lost at every opportunity. </p>
<hr>
<p>Followers will search where you have been, hoping to be the next to find the blade. All have vengeance to wreak.</p>
<h3 id="17-slaughter-bell">17. Slaughter Bell</h3>
<p>A short, bronze haft ending in a perfectly smooth orb of stone - off green, rich with veins of white and flecks of black. The weight is tremendous - swings ponderous. When a target is struck, the mace rings like a bell - a high, pure note, clinging to the air. The head resonates with this note, and each following note is louder - each strike more devastating.</p>
<p>Deals 1d6 damage. After each strike, attacks add 1 to damage and to hit. This bonus is cumulative, and lost if a strike does not connect. </p>
<h3 id="18-red-pouch">18. Red-Pouch</h3>
<p>A generous sling, made all of one continuous piece of oxblood leather. The cords whip the slinger upon release, always drawing blood and spraying it about. </p>
<p>Adds 2 to damage. Pursuers can always find your trail of blood.</p>
<hr>
<p>When the ransom was not paid for the Red Bull, it&#39;s captors chose humiliation. They castrated the bull and made  weapons of its scrotum. The river of blood from this castration led the rightful owners to the camp of the raiders.</p>
<h3 id="19-crystal-dagger">19. Crystal Dagger</h3>
<p>A dagger of crystal, inert at first. It is cold to the touch, and sits uncomfortably in the hand. Once someone is stabbed, it begins to thrum and warm. The two are linked - the wielder always knows the location of the most recent victim. The two are bound by blood.</p>
<p>Deals 1d6 damage.</p>
<hr>
<p>No story traces the beginning of such a weapon. It emerges as the weapon of a vizier with no introduction.</p>
<h3 id="20-bools-bane">20. Bool&#39;s Bane</h3>
<p>An oily lacquer coats this long, square blade, giving it a purple sheen. The pommel is intricately carved - birds striking down snakes. </p>
<p>Deals 1d6 damage. Adds 2 damage and to hit against shape-changers - regardless of their choice in the matter. Adds 3 damage against the divine. </p>
<hr>
<p>Across the sea, an island ruled by one who would paint themselves a godling. The isle was haunted with their hubris - failed half-unmade things crawled and begged for death. This was the instrument of their destruction. Sickened, the first wielder turned it on the master of the isle. </p>
<h2 id="11-20-magic-armours-d20">11-20. Magic Armours (d20)</h2>
<h3 id="1-mosquito-cloak">1. Mosquito Cloak</h3>
<p>Clothed in wing and leg, seeking proboscis fastens the garment tight. Insects are unhappy to swarm this closely, and make this distaste known in insistent buzzing. One wearing the Mosquito Cloak is either cursed or has set aside comfort in their pursuit of something beyond the human. The fact they wear any garment at all reveals how far they have to go before crossing the threshold. </p>
<p>AC as Unarmoured. -6 to Attack Rolls vs the wearer.<br>Unless they have augmented their senses, they are unable to see fine details or hear anything quiet through the linked swarm. </p>
<p>Worthless - anyone who would wear it will just kill you for it instead.</p>
<h3 id="2-war-mask-wolf">2. War-Mask, Wolf</h3>
<p>War is an inhuman space.<br>Masks abstract the human into the warrior.  </p>
<p>A snarling wolf clamps jaws down and over the face, teeth and snout of steel. Violent guardian, stinking of smoke and brine.  </p>
<p>The snout funnels and amplifies sound - once a day, a howl may be emitted which stuns those unable to Save. It  warps speech - the wearer cannot be understood by others.</p>
<hr>
<p>Markers of an empire consumed from within even as it retracted. Injustices were repaid as the tendrils retreated across the world. Such masks evoke feelings of obligation and fear. </p>
<h3 id="3-nautilus-helm">3. Nautilus-Helm</h3>
<p>Bronze tentacles coil eagerly, reaching down and forward. The crown and skull are cradled in a coiling shell, reinforced with bands of marble. There is slight upwards pressure, into the helm. </p>
<p>If the wearer is struck, they may choose to liquefy their bones. Their body warps to accommodate the strike without taking damage. There is a 10% chance this is permanent - otherwise they remain a puddle for 1 round before being restored to their normal form. In this puddle form they have AC as Plate-and-Shield, but may not strike.</p>
<h3 id="4-burned-shield">4. Burned Shield</h3>
<p>Once bitten, twice shy, and all the more eager to hide it.  </p>
<p>Improves AC by 1. -1 to Attack Rolls vs the wearer. Flame destroys it utterly and instantly. </p>
<h3 id="5-litter-shield">5. Litter-Shield</h3>
<p>Those carried back from war come atop shields. This shields has carried scores, and is marked by each. A chorus of corpses, each eager to be remembered again. Their names inscribe the shield in many scripts, mutually unintelligible. The shield wants no more corpses. It has seen enough of death. </p>
<p>Improves AC by 1. -3 to Attack Rolls vs the shieldbearer. Reduces the shieldbearer&#39;s damage dealt by 2. </p>
<h3 id="6-youngsap-battle-board">6. Youngsap Battle-board</h3>
<p>Wood too young, cut down too soon and eager for war. Sap beads no matter how many blows it deflects. It is like a dog with a new trick - it insists upon performance. Catching arrows is all it desires, bucking towards them. It does not ponder the string of corpses it has left.</p>
<p>Improves AC by 1. -1 to Attack Rolls vs the shieldbearer.  All hostile missile attacks aimed nearby are redirected to the shieldbearer. </p>
<h3 id="7-oathchain">7. Oathchain</h3>
<p>Halls gather shadows. They lurk and infiltrate, festering and destroying from within. Most have the wisdom to leave as the end encroaches, taking up the mantle of exile. Some do not, and are corrupted. </p>
<p>How many were abducted, dragged to up the hill to the hall? Mead flowed no longer. Only blood. By night the huscarls descended, tight-ringed mail silent, faces grim. None had the mettle to kill what once was their liege - now a blood-tyrant.</p>
<p>AC as Chain. -1 to Attack Rolls vs the wearer. Makes no noise.</p>
<hr>
<p>Their depredations ranged wide - many stories feature silent-armoured warriors seeking victims. Such figures are reviled and hated. Without their liege, violence is likely. </p>
<h3 id="8-veteran-chorus">8. Veteran Chorus</h3>
<p>First wire is forged. Then it is wrapped into rings, cut, ends hammered together. Then a hole is punched, the ring re-opened, then looped with others. Then they are riveted shut.  </p>
<p>There are over 20000 links in a chain shirt.  </p>
<p>Not all have to be from the same place - stripped from corpses, the damaged areas removed and replaced, one link at a time. The story of a suit is always far wider and bloodier than the wearer.  </p>
<p>If you listen, it can advise you - it knows the provenance and effectiveness of any other armour you see. </p>
<p>AC as Chain.</p>
<h3 id="9-the-hundred-blessings">9. The Hundred Blessings</h3>
<p>Denied the right to wear armour, the martial-monks inscribed prayers on ribbons of paper and attached them to their bodies with wax. In the case of a saint, these prayers worked. When they refused to produce such suits for secular leaders, they earned their martyrdom. </p>
<p>Originally a suit of 100 such prayers, 5d20 remain. Whenever damage would be taken, that many prayers fall away, having been completed. The damage is negated.</p>
<p>AC as Unarmoured. Useless without conversion. Being made of paper, easily ignited.</p>
<hr>
<p>Fellow believers plead with you for succour. Enemies of the faith drive you out as a troublemaker. Prince-bishops will try and usurp the suit from you.</p>
<h3 id="10-carrion-plate">10. Carrion Plate</h3>
<p>Holed, rusted and broken. Armour fit for a corpse, having clearly failed the living at least once. It has become blind to death - and blinds the wearer too. Entrails spool around feet which refuse to keep moving. </p>
<p>AC as Leather. Wearer does not die at 0HP - can suffer 2 additional hits before death.</p>
<h3 id="11-thousand-league-plate">11. Thousand League Plate</h3>
<p>Armour the colour of onions, made of curved plates. Always comes with duplicates, revealing the lie behind the stories - not a knight travelling impossibly fast, but identical suits of armour. But how did each know the deeds of the other? Donning the armour reveals the second trick - any wearing a linked suit are able to speak no matter the distance.  </p>
<p>What the stories do not mention is that the armour may not be removed. That too is found out once it is worn in its entirety. </p>
<p>AC as Plate. 1d6+1 suits found at once. </p>
<h3 id="12-landless-standard">12. Landless Standard</h3>
<p>Where lords own land, peasants chafe. Blood and ink denies them the fruit of their labours.<br>They may be illiterate, but they can spill enough blood to cover the ink.  </p>
<p>This thick shirt is damaged - twelve arrow-holes. The originator - their name struck from the record, those daring to speak it having their lips cut off - bested noble after noble in single combat, until the thirteenth - who bid his men to shoot the rebel to death instead.</p>
<p>AC as Unarmoured. Once per day, may issue a challenge to single combat which cannot be refused.</p>
<h3 id="13-sundrenched-cloak">13. Sundrenched Cloak</h3>
<p>An all encompassing garment, pure-white thread woven with beads of opaque glass in greens, reds, yellows. Invisible to the eye, the fabric sweats light which collected into these beads. Any disruption causes the light to rush out all at once, a blinding glare. </p>
<p>AC as Leather. -1 to Attack Rolls vs the wearer. The first 1d6 times the wearer is struck, all in line-of-sight must Save or be stunned and blinded for 1d6-2 rounds. </p>
<h3 id="14-the-bearskin">14. The Bearskin</h3>
<p>It smells like the forest. The scent fills your head - soil on the tongue, moss tickling the roof of your skull. Twigs scrape your throat. Walls offend - ursine eyes and ursine paws are not made for containment. Drop down on to all fours and wander outside...</p>
<p>Unless you learn to control it - tame it. Throw the pelt around your shoulders slowly. Do not let the smell entice you. Do not drop down onto all fours. Stride like human. Two legs, hands. Draw the head, eyes hollow, up over your own, but do not close your jaws around salmon or the invaders of your forest realm.  </p>
<p>Always take it off as soon as you are finished spilling blood.</p>
<p>AC as Leather. The wearer rolls damage dealt twice and takes the best result. Warding Save once a week or become a bear for 1d6 days. </p>
<h3 id="15-blooded-board">15. Blooded Board</h3>
<p>Blood is the lubricant of war and heroics - or so the practitioners have it. A thin bronze veneer, clear of decoration, wrapped around a wide wooden disc. When slick with blood, weapons skitter and dance across the surface. If not, it moves slowly, dragging itself through the air, unwilling to afford protection.</p>
<p>Gives an AC penalty of 1. Record each blood-drawing strike the shieldbearer is involved in (as a victim or an aggressor) in a bout of combat. For each strike, Attack Rolls vs the shieldbearer take a -2 penalty, to a maximum of -6.</p>
<h3 id="16-the-hedged-bet">16. The Hedged Bet</h3>
<p>A coat of leather filled with sealed pockets. The pockets of this coat are filled with gods. They are not compatible - the collection defies syncretism. Despite this, at least some might appreciate the effort - or be keen to outdo rivals within and without their pantheons, regions, realms. Several are false. Others are demons. It is impossible to isolate them. At night, you can hear the clinks and clanks as the plate-icons jostle and re-arrange themselves.</p>
<p>AC as Leather. -1 to Attack Rolls vs the wearer. Halves all damage from magical and elemental sources. 1-in-20 chance of pulling out an appropriate religious icon when needed.</p>
<h3 id="17-beached-plate">17. Beached Plate</h3>
<p>Fists alien to land beat themselves to a bloody pulp shaping this plate. Metal that has never known fire, only crushing abyssal depths and the teeth of salt. Designs etched of flowing curves, dancing patterns revealing a system of symbols knowable only to marine minds. How does one etch a history or a map when the world is liquid? What slaughter occurred so totally that such a precious item washed ashore?</p>
<p>AC as Leather. -6 to Attack Rolls vs the wearer. If an attack against the wearer rolls a 1 for damage, the weapon used is destroyed. </p>
<h3 id="18-the-mountains-inheritance">18. The Mountain&#39;s Inheritance</h3>
<p>Refuge from lords, kings and wars. The haunt of bandits. The mountain is ambivalent - all are welcome who can survive her cold embrace. Some impress enough for some mark to remain. Whilst rock-climbing, dancing between the stones, it was found - armour made of stone squares, linked by rings of volcanic glass. Each square is unique, craggy and rough in its own way. Such an heirloom is passed between mountain chiefs until some bandit-king acquires it. From there it inevitably ends up in the lowlands. If the suit is buried, a mountain will grow there over a hundred years.</p>
<p>AC as Plate. The wearer may not be compelled to move, nor pushed over or tripped.</p>
<h3 id="19-friend-to-murgo">19. Friend-to-Murgo</h3>
<p>Murgo forsook her city, but she did not forsake her armour.<br>Murgo forsook her friends, but she did not forsake her armour.<br>Murgo forsook her weapons, but she did not forsake her armour.<br>Her armour did not forsake her in return. A friend in bronze.</p>
<p>AC as Plate. -1 to Attack Rolls vs the wearer. For each of the following which are true, Attack Rolls are at an additional -1.</p>
<ul>
<li>At least 5 miles away from where you slept.</li>
<li>Have spoken less than 10 words to your travelling companions.</li>
<li>Not holding a weapon.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="20-the-mark">20. The Mark</h3>
<p>A skull like that of human, but larger. Heavier, the forehead thick, eyes wide beneath ridge brows. Big enough to fit your head inside and peer out. Inside, the bone is laden with runes and glyphs, still bearing traces of red pigment. Worn, these runes fire true - the skull is fused. The mark of a murderer. Who else would wear the skull of another?</p>
<p>-1 to Attack Rolls vs the wearer.</p>
<h2 id="21-60-magic-potions-d20">21-60. Magic Potions (d20)</h2>
<h3 id="1-potion-of-compression">1. Potion of Compression</h3>
<p>In truth no potion lies beyond the mirrored glass of this vessel - only a machine for the compression of the living. As it is drunk so it drinks - reducing the imbibers stature. This shrinking retains proportions. If the bottle is lost, this is permanent - otherwise slowly returning to normal over 4 hours.</p>
<h3 id="2-blood-of-command">2. Blood of Command</h3>
<p>Thick, oily and curdling upon the tongue, dissolving into intoxicating alcohol warmth. Imbibing this fluid lets this blood underline commands given - and those sharing this blood must Save or be compelled to follow instructions. 2d6 instructions can be given before the blood runs out.</p>

<h3 id="3-milk-of-kindness">3. Milk of Kindness</h3>
<p>Large earthenware demijohns of blue-tinged milk. Beneath a temple it gathers in pools - the stolen potential of a god kept asleep with prayer and milked for divine healing. It is heavily watered down with greed and fitful sleep. Every decade, the jugs get bigger. </p>
<p>Heals 1d6+1 HP. Takes two rounds to drink. If a Constitution Check is made, it can be chugged in a single round - failure wastes the potion.</p>
<h3 id="4-the-eager-dose">4. The Eager Dose</h3>
<p>It only wishes to please - weaving glamours of the desired effect as it is drunk. These illusions are visible to all. They last until an inconsistency reveals the lie.</p>
<h3 id="5-philtre-of-expansion">5. Philtre of Expansion</h3>
<p>Thin and watery. Tastes like old stew. The skin expands first, stretching up to four times the size. Then bones, muscle and finally organs. Treat as an Ogre for 4 hours - whereupon the stretching violently reverses. </p>
<h3 id="6-reviled-ointment">6. Reviled Ointment</h3>
<p>Unspeakable contents render the imbiber abhorrent to the ground itself. In 1d6 Turns, the air will turn against you too, and reject you equally.</p>
<h3 id="7-temporary-disintegration">7. Temporary Disintegration</h3>
<p>Tastes like pain and ozone. The imbiber is destroyed utterly, rendered into particles. In 2d6 Turns, these particles reform into a solid body. In the interim, the cloud retains the mind and will of the imbiber. They are able to move freely.</p>
<h3 id="8-potion-of-terrible-strength">8. Potion of Terrible Strength</h3>
<p>Thick, heavy, roiling - like swallowing wet mud. Tapped from the heart of a mountain. All attacks deal 2d6 damage. Every motion uses all of your newfound strength - your grip crushes skulls. Lasts 1d6 Turns.</p>
<h3 id="9-serpent-draught">9. Serpent Draught</h3>
<p>Evaporates on the tongue, leaving only an aftertaste of underripe berries. The imbiber moves at twice-speed - able to take two Rounds of actions in a single Round. For each Round past the first this effect is maintained, 1d6 damage is caused as skin peels away, dying without being replaced. This causes scarring.</p>
<h3 id="10-hero-mead">10. Hero-Mead</h3>
<p>Alcohol, Sour-honey and thick on the tongue. The imbiber is inebriated, but moved to feats of greatness. As they drink, they toast themselves - success in a single, specific heroic deed. If attempted in the next day, it succeeds. All attacks deal double-damage to one watched so closely by fate.</p>
<h3 id="11-inviolability">11. Inviolability</h3>
<p>A small bottle of ink, bright purple. By copying scripture - any scripture - across skin, the marked becomes untouchable to normal weapons and adds +2 to all saving throws. The effect lasts 2d6 Rounds. The ink lasts for 1d6 days.</p>
<h3 id="12-inverse-varnish">12. Inverse Varnish</h3>
<p>Something like thinner quicksilver with a despicable yet vague odour. Poured over a figure, they are rendered invisible, along with their equipment. The stench remains. The effect lasts until the liquid is removed, whether through water, scraping or vigorous motion.</p>
<h3 id="13-poison">13. Poison</h3>
<p>It&#39;s poison.<br>Save or die. </p>
<h3 id="14-the-sculptors-medium">14. The Sculptors Medium</h3>
<p>Tastes like dust and old wine. Watery. Any flesh touched by this substance becomes pliable to the hand - suitable for being remade into another form. The old form does not pass from memory - over 2d6 Turns, it reverts to the original.</p>
<h3 id="15-wax-of-refusal">15. Wax of Refusal</h3>
<p>Daubed across the skin, this pale yellow wax contains flakes of stone. They were chipped from the first tablet destroyed in anger. One covered in this wax may negate one attack, magical or otherwise. </p>
<h3 id="16-liquid-empathy">16. Liquid Empathy</h3>
<p>Tastes hot and salty-sweet. Oily on the tongue. The imbiber feels all feelings and hears all thoughts of living things within 50&#39;. They know the direction it is coming from. Stone is no impediment, although a full-face helmet stops this effect. Lasts 1d6 Turns.</p>
<h3 id="17-goldsong-elixir">17. Goldsong Elixir</h3>
<p>Tastes bland and empty. Very thick. Coats the vocal chords of the imbiber, who may sing the song of treasure. Listening closely, all treasure in the area will respond with a chorus. Relative volume indicates magnitude of the hoard. The song may be maintained to follow the sounds - incurring triple encounter rolls. </p>
<h3 id="18-batrachians-prize">18. Batrachian&#39;s Prize</h3>
<p>Tastes like salt. Silty texture. Breathing above and below water is the domain of the amphibian, and such is inviolate. The imbiber begins drowning in air. Lasts exactly 2d6 Turns. That night, the imbiber dreams of a great frog, squat and disapproving.</p>
<h3 id="19-welkin-love-potion">19. Welkin Love Potion</h3>
<p>Tastes like sweet jelly. The many hands of the air pluck and pull at the imbiber, lifting them upwards. The air is fickle, and so sustains them at about 4&#39; from the floor, rather than snatching them ever upwards. This potion can be applied to objects. It lasts until the weather changes, the air called away on it&#39;s errands. </p>
<h3 id="20-potion-of-architecture-friendship">20. Potion of Architecture Friendship</h3>
<p>Tastes like dust and chalk. Gritty, as you&#39;d expect. The imbiber is a treated as a friend to walls and doors. Such structural elements may be asked what they see. The walls will not lie - not to a friend. Lasts 1d6 Turns. For the duration, creatures of natural, elemental earth and stone will target you first.</p>
<h2 id="61-70-magic-rings-d20">61-70. Magic Rings (d20)</h2>
<p><em>Only one magic ring may be worn at a time.</em></p>
<h3 id="1-a-stolen-star">1. A Stolen Star</h3>
<p>Wrenched from the sky and bound in silver, a star twinkles distantly where a gem would otherwise sit. Gives gentle, ghostly illumination out to 10&#39;. Invisible beings are rendered visible in this alien light. </p>
<h3 id="2-fealty-ring">2. Fealty Ring</h3>
<p>Low-purity gold with a wide seal - depicting a figure kneeling before another. The inside edge of the ring is serrated - enough to irritate rather than cut. Within these grooves, a lingering trace of blood which never comes out. Worn by one who broke an oath - once a day, the wearer may whisper poison into a vial or the ear of another. The poison kills over 3 hours of agonising, stabbing pains. If a Save is made, the receiver of the poison knows exactly who did it.</p>
<h3 id="3-the-false-gift">3. The False Gift</h3>
<p>It is the tradition of kings and lords to give gifts to their companions. Of course, such gifts are not gifts - they are the purchase of fealty. Why should a lord not benefit more than this - in the absence of gifts they would be deposed swiftly. As long as this ring is worn, the one who <em>gifted</em> it receives +2 to Saving Throws and improves their AC by 2.</p>
<h3 id="4-hugo">4. Hugo</h3>
<p>A delicate thread of crystal - the rendered essence of an apprentice who demanded to know too much. The training of an apprentice is a bid for eternity - Hugo&#39;s master failed. A magic user may store a single spell within the ring by casting it. Hugo, craving knowledge, refuses to store the same spell twice. Hugo, reduced to a sliver  of crystal, only remembers the previous spell. </p>
<h3 id="5-the-bound-hand">5. The Bound Hand</h3>
<p>A silver ring, crudely hammered to fit a finger. Through focus and gesture, the wearer can move objects without touching them - up to 30&#39; away, and limited by their own strength. Those who can see the invisible witness the dead aping the motions of the wearer.<br>Those who kill kin know to bury the dead in chains of silver.</p>
<h3 id="6-slumber-the-cousin">6. Slumber the Cousin</h3>
<p>A brass ring dominated by a milky opal. The band is not straight - it wavers and undulates. Donned, the wearer sleeps. They may not be roused - but the waking world cannot effect them. </p>
<h3 id="7-nastroph">7. Nastroph</h3>
<p>A band of black stone, unadorned bar a single rune - a deep-cut X. It is always cool to the touch. The wearer may not die. They are still injured. If the ring is removed, they perish instantly.</p>
<h3 id="8-uspar">8. Uspar</h3>
<p>A stone ring, carved to have the appearance of a strange, delicate serpent, eyes glittering with murky topaz. The scales seem more like those of a fish. If the wearer pricks their ring-finger, the serpent returns to life, looking at them lovingly. It has the intelligence and loyalty of a well-trained dog. It&#39;s poison is not fatal to humans, but does debilitate them for 24 hours if a Save is not made. It can write in a language that predates humans, and fills them with dread. It returns to stone when the sun rises or sets - where it is.</p>
<h3 id="9-broken-white-token">9. Broken White Token</h3>
<p>A band of ivory, deeply stained black and red and scored with deep cuts. The edges of these cuts are razor-sharp. Once a mark of a pacifist oath, now it only seeks blood. What else could come from ivory but more blood? All damage rolls by and toward the wearer must re-roll dice results of 2 or less.</p>
<h3 id="10-ommon">10. Ommon</h3>
<p>A dirty gold ring, set with a device like a miniature sundial. It casts no shadow. Whilst worn, the wearer does not age, the ring absorbing the time. After a century, it ceases working - the weight of years rushing out all at once, and being piled upon the wearer. It already contains 1d100-1 years. </p>
<h3 id="11-promised-return">11. Promised Return</h3>
<p>A heavy iron ring, given before a long journey - a promise to return home. If the ring is in your possession, it seems they failed. Yet the ring yearns still - you always know the direction home, whatever that means to you. You can navigate off this feeling. If you are shifted out of your own reality, the ring pulls towards a way back to your own plane. If you ever return home, the ring becomes ordinary. </p>
<h3 id="12-the-witness">12. The Witness</h3>
<p>A ring made from a petrified tree, smoothed and carved. Uncomfortably chunky on the finger. The tree saw the stars fall, and could speak it into being again. Once per day, the caster may evoke the ring to cast <em>Fireball</em> and extinguish a star.</p>
<h3 id="13-unnamed">13. <em>Unnamed</em></h3>
<p>A ring made of glass talons, all curved inwards cruelly. They cut the wearer, again and again. The nature of these cuts stimulates healing - 1HP is recovered per Turn. A trail of blood is left in their wake. This feels like the beginning of an old path.</p>
<h3 id="14-the-seal">14. The Seal</h3>
<p>A thin silver band supports a wide electrum seal, depicting an incoherent mess of lines. Once worn, these resolve themselves - the wearers own personal seal. Once per day, they may mark an object using this seal - it becomes irrevocably their property. What this means is uncertain.</p>
<h3 id="15-dominion-reap">15. Dominion Reap</h3>
<p>A thick gold band set with pearls, emeralds, rubies and diamonds. Between them, elephants, leopards and bears in silver cavort. Compels others to speak in the wearer&#39;s language - even if they do not know it, tongues twitch to form alien words. </p>
<h3 id="16-the-chisel">16. The Chisel</h3>
<p>A wide bronze ring. On the outside is a bull, standing proud. On the inside, a dragon snakes it&#39;s head round to attack the bull from beneath. A hairline break runs around one side. Whilst worn, those who the wearer addresses directly will hear what they want to hear - any other listeners know the true meaning of the wearer&#39;s speech. </p>
<h3 id="17-rat-covenant">17. Rat Covenant</h3>
<p>The tails of a rat-king bound even tighter and tanned to form a ring. They still twitch. The wearer can converse with all rodents. Dogs bite the wearer - they are worried about usurpation by the rats.  </p>
<h3 id="18-the-opener">18. The Opener</h3>
<p>A clean steel ring with a small, sharp blade protruding outwards. If used in one swift movement to bisect a human being, the wearer can step into them, disappearing into the wound. This causes no damage. The wearer can re-emerge at any time in the next 12 hours. In the interim, they experience everything bar the thoughts of the person they hide within. </p>
<h3 id="19-fist-panoply">19. Fist Panoply</h3>
<p>A set of twelve rings, each adorned with studs. The two spare rings are far too wide for fingers, but do not fit over the hand. Punches made whilst wearing these rings deal damage as Two-Handed Sword, and insulate the wearer from any ill-effects from contact with the thing being punched.</p>
<h3 id="20-hulghavar">20. Hulghavar</h3>
<p>A rough wooden ring, the ridges standing out clearly. Once donned, small shoots reach out and embed themselves in the finger. The wearer cannot be touched by magical effects - nor can they remove the ring without losing a finger. No effect can cause the finger to grow back, and the stump always has small, green shoots emerging.</p>
<h2 id="71-75-magic-staves-d10">71-75. Magic Staves (d10)</h2>
<p><em>Each staff has an Ego score. If this is higher than a characters level, the staff requires bargaining with before allowing itself to be used. In the case of a major disagreement, the staff may try and dominate those with a lower Level than its ego - roll a Save for each level of difference. Failure indicates 1 Turn the staff remains in control.<br>Each staff wants to ensure its creator stays dead, wants to destroy other staves and to minimise the spreading of magical knowledge.</em><br><em>Where required, treat magical effects from a staff as from a 6th level Magic User.</em></p>
<h3 id="1-egron">1. Egron</h3>
<p>Bleach-white driftwood wrapped in snakes of gold, converging on an orb of murky amber at the top. Figures shift and move within the orb. Egron speaks in dreams using the imagery of volcanoes and oceans, teeming ants nests and wolfpacks. It believes itself a natural outcropping of a magic process set against the natural. It wants, eventually, for all reality subjugated to magic. It despises gods.  </p>
<p>Strikes as a normal staff. Beasts struck are subject to <em>Charm Person.</em><br>1/Day: <em>Light, Hold Monster, Hold Person, Fear.</em><br>Ego 2.  </p>
<h3 id="2-elovissa">2. Elovissa</h3>
<p>A narrow length of copper, the surface etched to a snake-skin pattern. It has no further ornamentation. In the air, it drags when swung - as if trailing some net. It speaks plainly and openly in the mind of the wielder - but condescendingly so. It believes it is the first and thereby ultimate staff - all others are reflections of it&#39;s own creation.   </p>
<p>Strikes as a normal staff.<br>1/Day: <em>Animate Dead, Anti-Magic Shield, Control Water.</em><br>Ego 5.  </p>
<h3 id="3-irosorin">3. Irosorin</h3>
<p>A length of flint, knapped into pseudo-smoothness and always warm to the touch. At it&#39;s head, three skulls are stacked - wolf, lion and bear. Each faces a different direction. Irosorin speaks through them - the chorus of dead voices from three loose jaws, held in place with gold wire. It speaks of mutual assistance, of power, the right of the strong to dominate the weak. It believes it can create a human as it was created by humans.</p>
<p>Deals 1d6+1 damage. On a result of 1 or 2, victim is paralysed as they are bit by one of the skulls - unless they Save.<br>1/Day: <em>Cure Serious Wounds, Dispel Magic, Move Earth.</em><br>Ego 2.   </p>
<h3 id="4-defeus">4. Defeus</h3>
<p>A gnarled, still living branch of olivewood. Mathematical equations naturally form in the bark, and any errant growths coil tight like the shells of snails. Defeus only communicates through these equations. It believes if all things could be recorded and computed, the world could be ended as the Question is solved. </p>
<p>Strikes as a normal staff.<br>1/Day: <em>Clairvoyance, Colour Spray, Dimension Door, Dispel Magic, Fireball.</em><br>Ego 3.  </p>
<h3 id="5-uzelin">5. Uzelin</h3>
<p>A short, stout rod of iron, patterns revealing meteoric origin playing across the surface. The air is always colder near Uzelin - grasping it without a glove is likely to result in skin freezing to the surface. Uzelin speaks audibly, in short, clipped sentences. It wants only to aid the wielder - hoping to be rewarded with destruction. It does not believe itself to be of this realm. It is correct. </p>
<p>Deals 1d6 damage. Those who are wet take an extra +2 from the bone-aching cold. Those supernaturally vulnerable to cold take 2d6 damage instead.<br>1/Day: <em>Haste, Invisibility, Lightning Bolt.</em><br>Ego 2.</p>
<h3 id="6-ordinas">6. Ordinas</h3>
<p>A length of silver chain, flames of blue and green forever reflected in it&#39;s sheen. Ordinas can stand rigid, but prefers to coil languidly like a snake. It speaks in caresses, nudges and gestures - trying to guide the wielder/wearer. Ordinas believes it can groom a wielder into gathering and then destroying a vast repository of magical knowledge - eventually aiming to set itself up a a god.</p>
<p>Deals 1d6-2 damage is swung as a chain. If a 1 is rolled, the target is set ablaze with magical flame - taking 1d6 damage a round until a 1 is rolled, whereupon the flames are extinguished.<br>1/Day: <em>Charm Monster, Locate Object, Passwall, Witch Eye</em><br>Ego 1/10. (Use the lower Ego score until the time comes for Ordinas to establish itself as a deity.)</p>
<h3 id="7-aethelheah">7. Aethelheah</h3>
<p>A gnarled staff made of mixed vertebrae. All are yellowed and dirty - although none of this grime is rubbed off on the wielder. The bones in the hands of wielders dance to a strange rhythm whilst Aethelheah is held. This is how it speaks - to bones and flesh directly. It believes that life abstracts itself in acts of creation into higher forms. It wants to create a successor. </p>
<p>Strikes as a normal staff.<br>1/Day: <em>Animal Growth, Baleful Polymorph, Plant Growth.</em><br>Ego 4.</p>
<h3 id="8-bashaa">8. Bashaa</h3>
<p>A length of white-gold, topped with a riot of brightly coloured feathers. The feathers twist and turn like the ears of a dog, trying to catch conversation. Bashaa speaks by replaying these snippets - sound collage. It believes that only that which it perceives truly exists - all else is nothing but a theory. Bashaa wants to know everything.</p>
<p>Strikes as a normal staff.<br>1/Day: <em>Detect Invisibility, Detect Magic, Knock, Locate Object, Magic Jar, Speak with Any.</em><br>Ego 6.</p>
<h3 id="9-ninorta">9. Ninorta</h3>
<p>A pole of ice-cold charcoal. Incredibly light, wondrously durable. Stains caused by Ninorta are permanent - and these swirling stain-patterns contain its messages. It believes in nothing. It wants only to be used to change the illusionary world. </p>
<p>Strikes as a normal staff.<br>1/Day: <em>Control Water, Cure Critical Wounds, Disintegrate.</em><br>Ego 1.</p>
<h3 id="10-ankhatefs">10. Ankhatefs</h3>
<p>A thin pole of ivory, tapering to a point on both ends. A single band of bronze loops around it - upon the band flowing patterns imitating waves. It speaks through animals, which cough up human words before fleeing, released from duty. Ankhatefs only wants to rule a kingdom. It would not be the first time.</p>
<p>Strikes a a normal staff.<br>1/Day:<em>Fear, Haste, Hold Person, Hold Portal, Insect Plague, Move Earth, Phantasm, Polymorph.</em><br>Ego 7.</p>
<h2 id="76-80-magic-grimoires-d10">76-80. Magic Grimoires (d10)</h2>
<p>Magical grimoires reward repeated study. Each has a <em>difficulty</em> score. This is how many weeks of study it requires before a spell is wrested from the grimoire. If your game is slower, this is weeks of intensive study. Pulpier games may allow study at camp to count. </p>
<h3 id="1-firelight-bead">1. Firelight Bead</h3>
<p>An amber bead with murky forms contained within. If held in the right position before a fire, pictograms are projected. They depict hunters, animals, fire, shelter and weather patterns, the movement of the flames animating them. They tell stories, if you allow yourself to listen.  </p>
<p>Difficulty 2.<br>Spells: <em>Animal Growth, Charm Animal, Control Weather, Hallucinatory Terrain, Lightning Bolt, Speak with Animals, Turn Undead.</em></p>
<h3 id="2-child-of-stone">2. Child of Stone</h3>
<p>Within the earth things grow. The earth does not love all of them equally. Some are banished.<br>Upon the lava plains they can be found - an armful of stone, egg-shaped, the rejected child of stone. Without the warm embrace of the earth, they dream, hoping to escape their isolation.<br>Bathed in molten lead, they awaken, and can be queried. They can act as tutors and sages - but all their knowledge is bitter. </p>
<p>Difficulty 1.<br>Spells: <em>Animate Dead, Baleful Polymorph, Curse, Circle of Protection(The Elements), Cloudkill, Fireball, Move Earth, Stone to Flesh.</em></p>
<h3 id="3-learned-spider">3. Learned Spider</h3>
<p>Whereupon arachnid minds learnt to weave spells is unknown - but this is a member of that secretive, aloof order. It is willing to share, encoding incantations in legible forms within webs. Why it is willing to do so is far less scrutable.</p>
<p>Difficulty 3.<br>Spells: <em>Cure Light Wounds, Bless, Hold Monster, Locate Object, Speak with Dead, Alter Self, Charm Person, Detect Magic, Haste.</em>  </p>
<h3 id="4-rat-king-nerve-map">4. Rat King Nerve-Map</h3>
<p>A Rat-King beneath a tower, within a dungeon, crawled up from some underworld - the origin is immaterial. The processing reveals the secret - flesh rendered away, a dozen squeaking voices pleading in every known tongue, until only the nerves are left. They are laminated, over and over, spread over a board, interlinked - and such delicate connections reveal sympathetic vibrations in the nature of things. </p>
<p>Difficulty 4.<br>Spells: <em>Animal Growth, Detect Invisibility, Invisibility, Sleep, Circle of Protection (Domesticated Animals), Lightning Bolt, Stone to Flesh.</em></p>
<h3 id="5-sevenfold-path-beyond-the-gate">5. Sevenfold Path Beyond the Gate</h3>
<p>A series of eight near-transparent vellum scrolls. All reference on another extensively - particularly the first. This acts as the gate. The opening acts as a cipher for all the rest - without enclosure, the space is rendered infinite and impossible. Only by passing and re-passing through the gate is the reader/practitioner able to circumvent the need for the gate. </p>
<p>Difficulty 7.<br>Spells: <em>Anti-Magic Shield, Clairvoyance, Comprehend Languages, Detect Invisibility, Detect Magic, Dispel Magic, Dimension Door, Disintegrate, Fog Wall, Hallucinatory Terrain, Passwall, Polymorph, Teleport.</em></p>
<h3 id="6-confessions--extractions">6. Confessions &amp; Extractions</h3>
<p>A small tome with a large lock. The surface has some minimal warping. If the lock is destroyed or a key found, the contents are revealed - the results of torture and witch-trails. The questions reveal a fascination by the torturer - but no mercy. As they converged on understanding, the answers become more usable. What the author did not realise - some of these spells are traps. </p>
<p>Difficulty 4 or Difficulty 1 if reader forgoes the ability to sleep due to nightmares.<br>Spells: <em>Animate Dead, Baleful Polymorph, Bless/Curse, Charm Person, Colour Spray, Control Water, Control  Weather, Cure Light, Serious, Critical Wounds, Enervate Dead, Haste, Invisibility, Locate Object, Plant Growth,  Sleep.</em></p>
<h3 id="7-library-flagstone">7. Library Flagstone</h3>
<p>A large stone, the top appearing slightly molten and very smooth. A flagstone from a library in a time and place where magic was learnt openly. Such a structure was inevitably burnt. The flagstone saw generations of learning - and some lessons well enough to repeat. Sleep upon it as a pillow, and resonate. </p>
<p>Difficulty 3, but does not require study.<br>Spells: <em>Anti-Magic Shield, Circle of Protection, Clairvoyance, Cloudkill, Comprehend Languages, Detect Invisibility, Detect Magic, Dispel Magic, Fly, Haste, Invisibility, Knock, Light, Locate Object,  Phantasm, Sleep, True Seeing, Web, Witch-Lock.</em></p>
<h3 id="8-twelfth-puzzle">8. Twelfth-Puzzle</h3>
<p>A tangle of silver and gold shapes, all moving independently yet held together in some unified organising principle. A toy, a puzzle. As one learns to manipulate it, they find themselves drawn inwards. It has lessons to teach for those able to solve it.</p>
<p>Difficulty 4.<br>Spells: <em>Charm Person, Colour Spray, Confusion, Fear, Haste, Move Earth, Neutralize Poison, Sixth Sense, Slow, Water Breathing.</em> </p>
<h3 id="9-blood-of-the-magi">9. Blood of the Magi</h3>
<p>A syringe, glass clear and metalwork brass. Blood, impossibly liquid, sloshes within. Injecting it hurts - years rush into your veins. The blood takes time to adjust. It slowly reaches the brain, and learns to talk. It is the essence of Deemethresu, a magi removed for generations. They will teach you. They are inescapable. They will only allow themselves to dissipate once all their knowledge has been passed on.</p>
<p>Difficulty 1.<br>Spells: <em>Baleful Polymorph, Charm Monster, Colour Spray, Confusion, Comprehend Languages, Continous Light, Dispel Magic, Fear, Fireball, Fly, Haste, Hold Monster, Invisibility, Light, Project Image, Slaying Spell, Wall of Fire, Wall of Ice, Witch Eye.</em><br>Ego 5 (see Staves)</p>
<h3 id="10-om">10. Om</h3>
<p>A huge assemblage of percussive instruments in a space designed specifically for their playing can, under the right conditions, produce the Sound. The Sound is resonant with Creation. One standing in the right spot to fully experience the Sound would gain some sort of Enlightenment. A magical aspirant would gain that knowledge. The Sound alters the instruments and the space such that it cannot be reproduced by them ever again.</p>
<p>Difficulty 0.<br>Spells: <em>All.</em>  </p>

<h3 id="1-wisdom-teeth">1. Wisdom Teeth</h3>
<p>A cloth bag, filled with 1d4-1 dirty, yellowed teeth. They are only recognisable as such from the material - the shapes are wrong, the ridges inconsistent. Holding them in your hand, they are always warm.<br>Through dentistry, one could try and force one into their mouth, needing to remove 1d4 teeth to make space. Human gums are too eager to accept these visitors - healing only takes a week, spent spitting blood. Each tooth has a random effect, usable once a day.</p>

<p>One with these teeth in their mouth is sure to be burnt as a witch, if discovered. Despite this, worth 2500sp each to jaded nobles and furtive practitioners. </p>
<h3 id="2-screaming-head">2. Screaming Head</h3>
<p>Cleft from the shoulders of the last of the Witch-men, this head still screams, eyes filled with malice, teeth sharp. They were driven into the woods, their homes burnt. The head will not die whilst the last generations of Witch-men keep the body alive in their subterranean lairs - living tombs for an extinguished people.</p>
<p>If the gag is removed, the ear-splitting screech forces all in earshot to Save or be deafened (for 1d6 Turns) and stunned (for 1d4 rounds). The Witch-men can always hear this scream, no matter the distance. A hunting band pursues. </p>
<hr>
<p><em>The name Witch-men has more to do with assumptions of the beholder than the genesis of such beings. In grasping to understand, we project the viewer outwards. All one is able to perceive is themselves. Why do we fear the reflection?</em></p>
<h3 id="3-bears-prize">3. Bear&#39;s Prize</h3>
<p>Fingers twitch still, evoking a spider more than a human. Veins of umber run through pallid flesh leading to talons tipping the eight digits, a sickening magnolia.  The wrist is all torn sinew. It is big enough to be worn has a glove, still-wet interior squeezing, embracing. Once donned, it cannot be removed without striking off the arm below the elbow.</p>
<p>Halve the Constitution of the wearer. When the hand is used in a task, double the Strength of the wearer. Once per day, the wearer may strike at the air, opening a portal as <em>Dimension Door.</em> Any gripped by the fist are subject to <em>Dispel Magic.</em></p>
<h3 id="4-stolen-shroud">4. Stolen Shroud</h3>
<p>To slip between the barrier of life and death, one must first confuse the living. A used funeral shroud, the donor body still in the ground. Whilst so attired, the wearer may interact with and see the immaterial dead as if they were tangible. Other undead will target them first, as they appear duplex to such fellow travellers. </p>
<h3 id="5-bitter-builders">5. Bitter Builders</h3>
<p>Glass orbs filled with earth and clay-brick-dust. They are in two halves, and can be unscrewed, allowing the contents to fall. If this mess is mixed with water, it assembles itself into a crude facsimile of a man. Pointed towards a structure, it will begin tearing it down with earthen fists. This complete, they crumble, merging with the rubble they have made. </p>
<p>Any instructional material relating to these orbs, found in buried ruins and flooded cities, details commands for the construction of buildings. Using any such commands causes the being to enter a killing frenzy. Their long wait has turned them hostile to the concept of building. </p>
<h3 id="6-seeking-dark">6. Seeking Dark</h3>
<p>A bottle full of empty. Pour it out, and bid it to seek.<br>Hounds couldn&#39;t follow a trail so well. </p>
<p>You will find the quarry surrounded by light - keeping the dark at bay. </p>
<h3 id="7-cracked-horn">7. Cracked Horn</h3>
<p>Old, yellowed-and-blackened, this horn is split open by a crack. Blowing upon it emits only a dry whisper of air. Those in earshot make no sound themselves as long as this horn is blown. </p>
<p>The gold bands around the body depict scenes of royal hunts and courts. The animals have human faces, and are blissful.</p>
<h3 id="8-leper-pearls">8. Leper Pearls</h3>
<p>Pus-yellow to rot-green pearls, slick and oily on the fingers. Sweated by the sick after ritual drownings in a healing-pool. A single bead is enough to poison a well for a year. </p>
<p>3d6 found at a time. </p>
<h3 id="9-ghoul-drum">9. Ghoul Drum</h3>
<p>Stolen from the warrens. The taut skin is obviously human. Beaten, the nearest ghouls answer the call. From tunnels and dens they emerge - from attics and basements. For every minute the drum is beat, 1d6 will appear. It takes each group 1d6 minutes to arrive.  </p>
<p>They have no loyalty to you - they must only answer the drum. </p>
<h3 id="10-elemental-rod">10. Elemental Rod</h3>
<p>A 2&#39; length of dun material. It absorbs heat and repels water. If brandished whilst commanding elementals, they will follow instruction. This is done out of fear, rather than compulsion - the rod annihilates them on contact. The rod is destroyed after 1d6 elementals have been destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="11-silvered-skull">11. Silvered Skull</h3>
<p>A raven skull, plated in silver and then painted over in black. The silver shines through the many scratches. Mounted upon a headless bird-body, it can act as a translator between humans and birds, the head rocking back and forth delightedly. </p>
<h3 id="12-pearl-eye">12. Pearl Eye</h3>
<p>An orb of pink-hued pearl, delicate imperfections of red tracing a vein-network just beneath the surface. Forced into an empty socket, it allows the host to scry an object or place three times a day. The object/place must be known in person or poetically.<br>This gives no indication of distance or relative location.<br>The orb rotates of it&#39;s own accord, seeing the unseen. </p>
<h3 id="13-worm-bones">13. Worm-Bones</h3>
<p>A light goatskin bag, filled with delicate coils of bone. Thrown, they burrow into the ground, seeking hosts. In 1d6 rounds, 2d20 skeletons emerge from the soil, ready to serve for 1d6 commands. The final command releases them upon completion.<br>When the bones are cast the first time, the user loses all body hair. The second time, their skin becomes moist - the sun deals 1HP of damage an hour as they dry. The third, fourth, fifth and sixth times, a random limb sloughs away.  </p>
<h3 id="14-mimesis-chisel">14. Mimesis Chisel</h3>
<p>By recreating the world it can be tamed - rewritten as it is altered. Using the chisel on a suitable media (wood, stone, flesh) a function of the subject can be duplicated or modified. The nose of a wolf, stolen by a hide mask. A storm abated by carving a placid sea. The chisel does not speed such works, and sloppy craftsmanship is sure to have unintended consequences. 
The world does not take kindly to imitators. Oppressors are hunted.</p>
<h3 id="15-wraps-of-lumash">15. Wraps of Lumash</h3>
<p>Coarse, dirty footwraps, crusted with salt. Wrapped tightly around the feet, the wearer feels a new spring in their step. Once per day, they are able to leap 10ft in the air from standing - the famed Salmon Jump of the first wearer. In the stories, he leapt over opponents and split the back of their head open. </p>
<h3 id="16-whales-eye">16. Whale&#39;s Eye</h3>
<p>Shrivelled and leather-brown, but once round and firm and plucked from the head of a whale set on ship-sinking.  Mounted on a ship, it causes blindness in sea monsters. It could be thrown at a monster of the land to create the same effect. Doing so destroys the remains of the eye.</p>
<h3 id="17-silver-nails">17. Silver Nails</h3>
<p>A black velvet bag of silver nails, each 3&quot; long. A matching silver hammer, carved with eyes which watch in all directions. The holder of the hammer always knows the direction and distance of the nails. Each nail is a binding.</p>
<h3 id="18-mirror-of-negation">18. Mirror of Negation</h3>
<p>Things that dance upon the silvered surface are reflections - hollow, filled with nothing but yearning for a selfhood untethered from the original. Such a yearning is death for a reflection. The first time this delicate, unornamented mirror is unveiled, duplicates of anything reflected within emerge, set to kill their originals. What did your reflection do before you tethered it? </p>
<p>Once all reflection are dead, the mirror cracks, ruined forever. </p>
<h3 id="19-the-water-bell">19. The Water Bell</h3>
<p>An immense gold torus - enough to burden an oxen. It is hollow. If struck normally, a simple resonant gong. If struck when full of water, it evokes primal fear in all humans and posthumans within earshot. Something in the mind remembers. </p>
